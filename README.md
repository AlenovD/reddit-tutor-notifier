# Reddit Client Acquisition Bot 

An automated lead generation tool that monitors niche subreddits in real-time and pushes filtered leads to a private Telegram channel. Designed to reduce the time-to-response for freelance tutoring opportunities.

## Overview
This bot automates the reddit browsing process by:
1.  Polling the Reddit API for new posts in specific communities (e.g., r/Tutor, r/MathHelp).
2.  Filtering titles against high-intent keywords ("math", "help", "online").
3.  Delivering instant, formatted notifications to Telegram with links to post.
